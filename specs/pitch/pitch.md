## Problem:

Many people are curious about their future and seek ways to gain insight into what may lie ahead for them. However, traditional methods of fortune-telling, such as tarot readings and psychic consultations, can be costly and time-consuming. There is a need for an online platform that can provide accurate and personalized predictions about one's future. As a result, our groups idea is to create a website that gives people a free tarot-reading service. We will follow contemporary tarot reading rules and regulations in order to give out fortunes to our users.

## Appetite:

We will spend around six weeks (until the end of the quarter) on this project, aiming to create a simple and user-friendly website that provides users with quick and personalized fortune readings through tarot cards. Our main focus will be on creating an algorithm that generates predictions based on the user's input and displaying the content in a user-friendly way.

## Solution:

Our tarot card fortune-telling website will offer users the ability to receive personalized predictions about their future in a matter of seconds. The user will be prompted to shuffle a deck until they are satisfied. Then, the website will display the top 12 cards in the deck and discard the rest. The user will then be prompted to choose 3 of the 12 cards displayed. It is important to note that the 12 cards displayed are face down so that the user does not know the value of the card before they choose it. Finally, we will generate a unique response to the combination of the cards chosen. We will have a fortune for each individual card, and an overall explanation of what the userâ€™s fortune is based on the 3 cards chosen. The user will also be able to view the other potential cards in the deck.

## Rabbit holes:

To ensure the accuracy of the tarot card interpretations, our algorithm will allow users to select tarot cards at random to be read and interpreted by ChatGPT. We will need to invest time in researching and developing this algorithm to ensure our program simulates a tarot card reading as accurately as possible. Additionally, we will need to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to input their questions and concerns to receive their reading.

## No-gos:

We will not be providing any medical, legal, or financial advice on our website. We will also not be offering any services related to spellcasting, witchcraft, or similar practices. Our goal is to provide personalized fortune readings that are fun and insightful, but we will not make any claims about their validity or accuracy. We will also not collect or store any personal information beyond what is necessary to generate the fortune reading.
