# Deciding on code style

## Context and Problem Statement

What style will the team use when developing the website?

## Options To Consider

- Comments
- Maximum line length
- Function/variable naming
- indentation
-

## Decision Outcome

Our team decided to use comment blocks for functions and resort to inline-comments whenever necessary. Our maximum line length will be 80 characters in order to make the code readable on most screens. We also decided to use camelCase for our naming convention. In terms of indentation, we will be using tab size for indentations.
