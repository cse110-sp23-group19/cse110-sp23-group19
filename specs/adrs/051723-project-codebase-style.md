# ADR: Coding Guidelines for our Project

## Context
As a development team, we recognize the importance of maintaining consistent and high-quality code across our project. To achieve this, we need to establish clear coding guidelines that outline the best practices and standards to be followed by all team members.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt the following coding guidelines for our project:

1. Code Formatting:
   - We will use a consistent code formatting style throughout the project to enhance readability and maintainability.
   - For JavaScript code, we will follow the popular JavaScript Standard Style or Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
   - For HTML and CSS, we will adhere to the recommendations of the W3C standards and maintain clean and well-organized code.

2. Naming Conventions:
   - We will use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and other code entities.
   - CamelCase will be used for naming variables and functions, starting with a lowercase letter (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateTotal()`).
   - PascalCase will be used for naming classes and components, starting with an uppercase letter (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyComponent`).
   - All names should be concise, clear, and self-explanatory.

3. Comments and Documentation:
   - We will encourage the use of comments to explain complex logic, document function parameters and return values, and provide clarity where necessary.
   - Comments should be concise, relevant, and kept up-to-date with the code.
   - For public APIs and significant code sections, we will provide detailed documentation using tools like JSDoc or Markdown.

4. Error Handling and Exception Handling:
   - We will implement proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability of the code.
   - Exceptions should be caught and appropriately handled, providing meaningful error messages or logging.

5. Modularity and Reusability:
   - We will strive for modular and reusable code by following the principles of SOLID design and component-based architecture.
   - Code should be organized into small, cohesive modules, promoting separation of concerns and easy maintainability.
   - Reusable code should be abstracted into functions, classes, or components to avoid duplication.

6. Version Control and Git Workflow:
   - We will utilize version control, preferably Git, to track changes and collaborate effectively.
   - Branching strategies like GitFlow or GitHub Flow can be adopted to manage feature development, bug fixes, and release cycles.
   - Meaningful commit messages and pull request descriptions should be used to provide clear and concise information about the changes made.

Alternatives Considered:
We considered various coding guidelines and style guides, such as Google JavaScript Style Guide and TypeScript Style Guide. However, we chose to adopt the JavaScript Standard Style or Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide due to their wide adoption, community support, and alignment with modern JavaScript best practices.

Conclusion:
By adopting these coding guidelines, we aim to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability throughout our project. Consistency in coding practices will enable efficient collaboration, reduce errors, and make the codebase more approachable for new team members. Regular code reviews and continuous improvement of our coding guidelines will ensure that we deliver a high-quality and maintainable software solution.
