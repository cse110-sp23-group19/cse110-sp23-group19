# ADR: Selection of CSS Framework for our Project

## Context
As a development team, we need to decide on a CSS framework to streamline the development process and enhance the styling capabilities of our project. CSS frameworks provide pre-designed components and utilities that can significantly speed up development and ensure consistency.

## Decision
After careful consideration, we have decided to adopt the Bootstrap CSS framework for our project.

## Rationale

1. Rich Feature Set:
   - Bootstrap offers a comprehensive set of pre-designed components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and modals, which can be easily integrated into our project.
   - The framework provides responsive design capabilities out-of-the-box, ensuring that our project is accessible and optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
   - Bootstrap also includes utility classes and helper functions that facilitate common styling tasks and enhance productivity.

2. Large Community and Ecosystem:
   - Bootstrap has a large and active community of developers, which means abundant resources, documentation, and community-driven support.
   - Numerous third-party plugins and extensions are available, offering additional functionality and customization options.
   - Bootstrap is widely adopted and has been extensively tested across different browsers and devices, ensuring better cross-browser compatibility.

3. Customization and Theming:
   - Bootstrap allows for easy customization, enabling us to adapt the framework's styles and components to our project's specific design requirements.
   - With Bootstrap's SASS variables and mixins, we can easily modify colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements.
   - Bootstrap also provides a theming system that allows us to create a consistent visual identity by customizing colors, fonts, and other aspects of the framework.

4. Documentation and Learning Resources:
   - Bootstrap offers comprehensive and well-structured documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the framework's features.
   - The framework has extensive online resources, tutorials, and community-driven examples, facilitating the learning process for new team members.

Alternatives Considered:
We considered other popular CSS frameworks like Foundation, Bulma, and Tailwind CSS. While each of these frameworks has its merits, we determined that Bootstrap aligns better with our project's requirements in terms of its rich feature set, community support, customization options, and learning resources.

Conclusion:
By selecting the Bootstrap CSS framework, we aim to leverage its extensive set of pre-designed components, responsive design capabilities, and customization options to expedite development and ensure consistency in our project's styling. The large community and ecosystem surrounding Bootstrap will provide valuable support and resources throughout the development process, making it an ideal choice for our project.
